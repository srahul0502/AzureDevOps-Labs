# Deploying and Configuring a High-Availability Azure Load Balancer

## Notes to Instructor

### Common Challenges and Tips

1. **Network Configuration Issues:**
    - Students may forget to assign VMs to the same subnet or configure inbound port rules.
    - **Tip:** Verify that the VMs belong to the same virtual network and subnet.

2. **Health Probe Configuration:**
    - Students might not correctly configure health probes, resulting in unhealthy backend VMs.
    - **Tip:** Ensure correct protocol and port settings in the health probe (e.g., HTTP on port 80).

3. **Load Balancing Issues:**
    - Students might misconfigure load balancing rules, leading to traffic going to only one VM.
    - **Tip:** Confirm that both VMs are added to the backend pool, and session persistence is disabled.

## Submission Checklist

- Architecture diagram of VNet, Load Balancer, and backend pool connections
- **Screenshots:**
    - Virtual network and subnet configurations
    - Load Balancer settings (frontend, backend pool, and health probes)
    - Traffic distribution validation across backend VMs
- Detailed report with verification steps and traffic test results

### Sample Report Summary

**Verification Tips:**

- **Virtual Network:** Ensure the subnet IP range allows proper communication.
- **Backend Pool:** Confirm all VMs are in the backend pool and marked as "healthy."
- **Health Probes:** Validate success status for each backend VM.
- **Traffic Distribution:** Test with multiple refreshes to see responses from different VMs.

**Areas for Assistance:**

- Misconfigured health probes
- Backend pool not correctly associated
- Load balancing rule issues

## Solution:

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Network and Subnet

1. Go to the Azure Portal > Virtual Networks > Create Virtual Network.
    - **Name:** MyVNet
    - **Address Space:** 10.0.0.0/16
    - **Subnet Name:** MySubnet
    - **Subnet Address Range:** 10.0.0.0/24
    - Click **Review + Create** > **Create**.

    ðŸ’¡ Instructor Tip: Explain the purpose of subnets in isolating and managing network traffic within virtual networks.

### Step 2: Create Virtual Machines (VMs)

1. Navigate to Azure Portal > Virtual Machines > Create.
    - **Name:** VM1, VM2
    - **Region:** Select the same region as the virtual network
    - **Image:** Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
    - **Size:** Standard B1s or equivalent
    - **Authentication Type:** Password
    - **Virtual Network:** Select MyVNet
    - **Subnet:** Select MySubnet
    - **Public IP:** None
    - **Inbound Port Rules:** Allow HTTP (Port 80)
    - Click **Review + Create** > **Create**.

    ðŸ’¡ Instructor Tip: Explain why VMs should have no public IPs in this setup â€” traffic will be routed via the Load Balancer.

### Step 3: Install Web Servers on VMs

1. Connect to each VM via the Azure Cloud Shell or SSH.
2. Run the following commands to install Apache:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install apache2 -y
    echo "Welcome to VM1!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
    sudo systemctl start apache2
    ```

    Repeat the same commands on VM2, but change the message to "Welcome to VM2!"

    ðŸ’¡ Instructor Tip: Help students understand that these simple web servers will simulate real backend services for the Load Balancer.

### Step 4: Create an Azure Load Balancer

1. Go to Azure Portal > Load Balancers > Create.
    - **Resource Group:** Select an existing group or create a new one
    - **Name:** MyLoadBalancer
    - **Region:** Select the same region as the VMs
    - **Type:** Public
    - **Frontend IP Configuration:** Create a new public IP
    - Click **Review + Create** > **Create**.

### Step 5: Configure Backend Pool

1. Go to the Load Balancer resource > Backend Pools.
2. Click **Add Backend Pool:**
    - **Name:** MyBackendPool
    - **Virtual Network:** Select MyVNet
    - **Backend Pool Configuration:** Add VM1 and VM2.
    - Click **Add**.

    ðŸ’¡ Instructor Tip: Ensure students understand that backend pools are where the Load Balancer routes traffic.

### Step 6: Create Health Probes

1. Go to Load Balancer > Health Probes > Add a Health Probe.
    - **Name:** MyHealthProbe
    - **Protocol:** HTTP
    - **Port:** 80
    - **Interval:** 5 seconds
    - **Unhealthy Threshold:** 2

### Step 7: Configure Load Balancing Rules

1. Go to Load Balancer > Load Balancing Rules > Add a Rule.
    - **Name:** MyLBRule
    - **Frontend IP:** Select the public IP
    - **Backend Pool:** Select MyBackendPool
    - **Protocol:** TCP
    - **Port:** 80
    - **Session Persistence:** None
    - Click **Add**.

### Step 8: Verify Traffic Distribution

1. Copy the public IP of the Load Balancer.
2. Open a web browser and access the IP multiple times.
3. Verify that traffic is distributed across VM1 and VM2 by seeing alternating messages ("Welcome to VM1!" and "Welcome to VM2!").

    ðŸ’¡ Instructor Tip: Emphasize the importance of testing load distribution to ensure proper configurations.

## Submission Checklist

- Architecture diagram of the Load Balancer setup
- **Screenshots of:**
    - Virtual Network and subnet configuration
    - Load Balancer settings (frontend, backend pool, health probes)
    - Traffic distribution test results
- A report detailing:
    - Key configuration steps
    - Challenges faced and solutions

### Sample Report Summary

**Verification Tips:**

- Ensure backend VMs are marked "healthy" under the Load Balancer settings.
- Test traffic distribution by refreshing the browser multiple times.

**Common Errors:**

- Backend pool misconfiguration
- Incorrect health probe settings

## Additional Notes

- Encourage students to troubleshoot independently and ask questions when stuck.
- Highlight best practices for scalable network design and the importance of health probes in maintaining high availability.

## Solution Summary

1. **Create Virtual Network and Compute Resources:**
    - Deploy a virtual network and at least two virtual machines
    - Configure each VM to allow traffic on port 80

2. **Configure Load Balancer:**
    - Create a public-facing Load Balancer
    - Configure frontend IP and backend pool with the deployed VMs

3. **Configure Health Probes and Load Balancing Rules:**
    - Create a health probe on port 80
    - Set up a load balancing rule for HTTP traffic

4. **Test and Verify:**
    - Access the Load Balancer's public IP
    - Validate that traffic is distributed among backend VMs
