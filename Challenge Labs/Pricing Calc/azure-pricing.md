- An active Microsoft account.
- Basic understanding of Azure services.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will:
- Navigate and utilize the Azure Pricing Calculator.
- Estimate and compare costs for common Azure services.
- Create, save, and share detailed pricing estimates.
- Analyze cost implications of different service configurations.

## Description
The Azure Pricing Calculator is a crucial tool for anyone planning to deploy services on Azure. This lab will challenge you to explore its features, configure pricing estimates for different scenarios, and verify the accuracy of cost assessments. You will also practice saving and sharing estimates for stakeholder collaboration.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Explore the Azure Pricing Calculator
#### Goal
Familiarize yourself with the Azure Pricing Calculator interface and features.

#### Instructions
1. Navigate to the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/).
2. Review the main sections: the search bar, service categories, and pricing estimate summary.
3. Add at least three services to your pricing estimate, such as:
   - Virtual Machines (VMs)
   - Storage Accounts
   - App Services
4. Observe how pricing changes when you adjust configurations.

#### Verification
- Ensure that you have successfully added at least three services.
- Verify that the total cost summary updates as configurations are adjusted.

### Task 2: Configure Pricing Estimates for a Scenario
#### Goal
Estimate costs for a hypothetical e-commerce solution deployed on Azure.

#### Instructions
1. Add the following services to your pricing estimate:
   - **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Choose a Windows VM with Standard D2s v3 configuration in the East US region.
   - **Storage Account**: Select a general-purpose v2 account with 100 GB of storage.
   - **App Service**: Add a Standard S1 plan.
2. Customize each service configuration based on the following requirements:
   - Assume the solution requires high availability.
   - Estimate the costs for a one-year period.

#### Verification
- Confirm that all services have been added and configured correctly.
- Ensure the total monthly and yearly cost estimates are displayed.

### Task 3: Analyze and Optimize Costs
#### Goal
Identify ways to reduce costs for the e-commerce solution.

#### Instructions
1. Experiment with different configurations, such as:
   - Changing the VM size.
   - Switching regions.
   - Adjusting storage account redundancy options.
2. Document changes and compare cost differences.

#### Verification
- Ensure that your optimized pricing estimate reflects cost reductions.
- Provide a summary of the changes made and their cost impact.

### Task 4: Save and Share Pricing Estimates
#### Goal
Learn to export and share pricing estimates.

#### Instructions
1. Click on the **Export** or **Share** option in the pricing calculator.
2. Save the pricing estimate as a file or generate a shareable link.

#### Verification
- Ensure that you have successfully saved or shared the pricing estimate.
- Verify the accessibility of the exported file or link.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Submit screenshots of the initial and optimized pricing estimates.
2. Provide a shareable link or exported file of your final pricing estimate.
3. Include a brief report detailing:
   - Initial configurations and estimated costs.
   - Optimization strategies and resulting cost savings.
   - Rationale behind your configuration choices.
