# Mastering the Azure Pricing Calculator

## Notes to Instructor
This lab is designed to give learners hands-on experience with the Azure Pricing Calculator. They will explore service configurations, estimate costs, and identify optimization strategies.

### Common Challenges
1. **Service Selection Confusion:** Learners may struggle to identify the correct services for the e-commerce scenario.
   - **Suggestion:** Remind them to search for specific services (e.g., Virtual Machines, App Services) in the calculator.

2. **Configuration Complexity:** Customizing VM sizes and storage options might be overwhelming.
   - **Suggestion:** Guide learners to use basic configurations first and then gradually explore advanced options.

3. **Cost Optimization:** Learners may not immediately identify effective cost-saving strategies.
   - **Suggestion:** Encourage experimentation with regional options and different redundancy settings for storage.

4. **Exporting Estimates:** Learners may have trouble finding the export and share features.
   - **Suggestion:** Show where the export button is located on the pricing summary page.

### Submission Checklist
1. Screenshots of initial and optimized pricing estimates.
2. A shareable link or exported file of the final pricing estimate.
3. A brief report covering:
   - Initial configurations and estimated costs.
   - Optimization strategies and resulting cost savings.
   - Rationale behind configuration choices.

### Sample Report Summary
**Initial Configuration:**
- **Virtual Machine:** Windows VM Standard D2s v3 in East US ($120/month).
- **Storage Account:** General-purpose v2 with 100 GB ($20/month).
- **App Service:** Standard S1 plan ($70/month).
- **Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** $210.

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Reduced VM size to Standard B2ms.
- Changed storage redundancy from LRS to ZRS.
- Moved services to the "West US" region.

**Final Optimized Estimate:**
- Total Monthly Cost: $160.
- Annual Savings: $600.

**Verification Tips:**
- Verify that learners have correctly configured the specified services.
- Ensure the cost estimates reflect the configuration choices.
- Check for documentation of optimization strategies and their impact.

### Areas for Assistance
1. **Service Misconfiguration:** Ensure learners select the correct VM and storage options.
2. **Incorrect Cost Estimates:** Verify that cost changes reflect optimization efforts.
3. **Incomplete Report:** Confirm that learners document rationale and provide screenshots.

## Solution
1. Navigate to [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/).
2. Add Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and App Services.
3. Configure the services based on task requirements.
4. Optimize costs by adjusting service configurations.
5. Export and share the pricing estimate.
6. Document the report, including screenshots and a summary.

## Additional Notes
- Encourage learners to explore additional services in the Azure Pricing Calculator.
- Discuss real-world scenarios where cost optimization is essential.
- Provide examples of cost-saving strategies used by industry professionals.
