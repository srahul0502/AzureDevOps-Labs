# Azure Storage: Create a Blob Storage and Connect via Storage Explorer

## Lab Overview

This challenge lab requires you to independently provision and configure Azure Blob Storage, then connect to it using Storage Explorer. You will create secure storage containers, upload files, and validate access configurations.

## Pre-requisites

- Active Azure subscription
- Familiarity with:
    - Azure Storage accounts and Blob containers
    - Network and security configurations
- Experience with Storage Explorer and Azure Portal

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, you will:

- Create and configure Azure Blob Storage
- Manage containers and upload files
- Connect and manage Blob Storage through Storage Explorer
- Validate data access and permissions

## Description

You are tasked with creating an Azure Storage account, setting up a Blob Storage container, and managing data access via Storage Explorer. Validate that the container can securely store and retrieve files.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Deploy a Storage Account

**Objective:** Ensure the storage account supports secure and efficient blob storage while adhering to best practices.

**Instructions:**

- Set up an Azure Storage Account with best practices for performance and redundancy
- Ensure the account supports secure access and efficient blob storage

**Verification:**

- Confirm that the storage account is provisioned and accessible in the Azure Portal

### Task 2: Configure Blob Storage Containers

**Objective:** Create and configure secure containers for private data storage within the Storage Account.

**Instructions:**

- Create blob containers to store private files
- Ensure the appropriate access levels for secure data storage

**Verification:**

- Confirm container setup and access levels

### Task 3: Connect to Storage via Azure Storage Explorer

**Objective:** Establish secure and authenticated access to the Blob Storage using Storage Explorer.

**Instructions:**

- Independently connect to the Blob Storage using Storage Explorer
- Navigate through containers and blobs

**Verification:**

- Confirm successful authentication and connection

### Task 4: Data Operations Challenge

**Objective:** Demonstrate the ability to perform essential data operations and configure blob properties.

**Instructions:**

- Upload a file (e.g., datafile.txt)
- Download the same file and validate its integrity
- Modify blob access tiers and metadata

**Verification:**

- Validate successful data operations

## Submission Guidelines

Submit the following:

- **Screenshots:**
    - Storage account and container setup
    - File upload in the container
    - Successful connection in Storage Explorer
- **Summary Report:**
    - Briefly describe steps taken, challenges faced, and key results observed
